## 0. Executive Overview (1–2 pages)

**Purpose:** Give execs the story in one coffee.

**Core moves:**

- Current reality: brilliant people, broken operating model → firefighting, rework, decision latency, wasted cognition → slow outcomes
- Flow lens: queues, large batches, over-utilisation, lack of economic prioritisation are killing throughput and value. ([BPTrends](https://bptrends.info/wp-content/uploads/05-06-2014-BR-The-Principles-of-Product-Development-Flow-Bellinson.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Progressive elaboration lens: NAB has already chosen rolling-wave as the standard way of working ([Medium](https://medium.com/%40nabtechblog/shifting-to-progressive-elaboration-and-choosing-rally-ea31b1904405?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) – but we still “push” too much work and plan too manually.
- AI lens: AI collapses planning latency, shrinks batch sizes, and enables context-rich flow – freeing humans to focus on the final 10–20% of judgment-heavy work.
- Outcome: an AI-first Flow Operating Model that can be piloted in your domain and scaled across the bank.

**Visual:**

## 1. The Problem: Firefighting as an Operating System

**Purpose:** Ground the pain in Flow language, not hand-wavy frustration.

**Content:**

- Symptoms you see every day:
    - Design bottlenecks, pixel tweaking, unclear problem framing.
    - Product swamped with tickets, no time for economics or strategy.
    - Process / change / BA teams living in Visio/Confluence, not influencing outcomes.
    - Engineering and QA overloaded, context-switching, late test discovery, rework.
- Flow diagnosis:
    - Invisible queues of work, high utilisation → long cycle times, delays and higher cost. ([BPTrends](https://bptrends.info/wp-content/uploads/05-06-2014-BR-The-Principles-of-Product-Development-Flow-Bellinson.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - Large “planning batches” (big docs, big initiatives, big design cycles). ([PDMA](https://www.pdma.org/page/review_principles_pr?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - No explicit cost of delay → everything feels “top priority”. ([Andrew Doran](https://andrewdoran.uk/readmill/resources/reading_the-principles-of-product-development-flow-second-generation-lean-product-development.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- NAB context: progressive elaboration is adopted, but in practice we still:
    - Start work too early.
    - Over-commit teams.
    - Treat rolling-wave as a meeting ritual, not an evolving decision engine. ([Medium](https://medium.com/%40nabtechblog/shifting-to-progressive-elaboration-and-choosing-rally-ea31b1904405?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Visuals:**

- “Firefighting pipeline”: simple left-to-right diagram showing idea → huge queue → multiple hand-offs → rework loops → late value.
- Optional heat-map overlay on the pipeline to show where design, BA, engineering, testing are currently burning out.

## 2. Foundations: Flow + Progressive Elaboration + AI

**Purpose:** Establish the conceptual spine of the paper.

### 2.1 Flow Principles in Product Development

- Summarise the key families of Reinertsen principles in plain language:
    - Economics (cost of delay, local decisions based on value). ([Andrew Doran](https://andrewdoran.uk/readmill/resources/reading_the-principles-of-product-development-flow-second-generation-lean-product-development.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - Queues & WIP (queue size multiplies delay; high utilisation increases queues). ([BPTrends](https://bptrends.info/wp-content/uploads/05-06-2014-BR-The-Principles-of-Product-Development-Flow-Bellinson.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - Batch size (small batches → faster feedback & lower risk). ([LPD2](https://lpd2.com/sample-page/the-principles-of-flow/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - Variability & feedback (we can’t add value without variability; shorten feedback loops). ([Ardalis](https://ardalis.com/principles-of-product-development-flow-book-review/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - Decentralised control (push decisions closer to teams when they have information). ([LPD2](https://lpd2.com/sample-page/the-principles-of-flow/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 2.2 Progressive Elaboration & Rolling Wave

- Definition: continuously refining plan detail as information emerges; near-term detailed, far-term high-level. ([Project Management](https://www.projectmanagement.com/wikis/295452/progressive-elaboration?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Rolling-wave planning as a concrete expression. ([Mosaic Projects](https://www.mosaicprojects.com.au/WhitePapers/WP1060_Rolling_Wave.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- NAB’s adoption of progressive elaboration and Rally (engineer focus, backlog management, rolling waves). ([Medium](https://medium.com/%40nabtechblog/shifting-to-progressive-elaboration-and-choosing-rally-ea31b1904405?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 2.3 AI as the Acceleration Layer

- AI speeds up: context gathering, drafting, decomposition, exploration of options, tests, architecture sketches.
- AI collapses “thinking and writing” time, not just execution time → this is where progressive elaboration becomes continuous and cheap instead of heavy.

**Visuals:**

- A 3-layer stack:
    - *Bottom*: Flow principles (queues, WIP, batch size, cost of delay).
    - *Middle*: Progressive elaboration (rolling waves, evolving plans).
    - *Top*: AI acceleration (context libraries, assistants like Cursor, Copilot).
- Arrows upwards labelled “throughput”, “decision quality”, “adaptability”.

## 3. Economics of Flow in an AI-First Bank

**Purpose:** Give execs the “why now” in hard economic language.

**Content:**

- Recap Reinertsen:
    - Cost of delay makes queues visible and motivates managing them. ([Andrew Doran](https://andrewdoran.uk/readmill/resources/reading_the-principles-of-product-development-flow-second-generation-lean-product-development.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    - Big queues + high utilisation = congestion, delays, higher cost. ([BPTrends](https://bptrends.info/wp-content/uploads/05-06-2014-BR-The-Principles-of-Product-Development-Flow-Bellinson.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Progressive elaboration as an economic tool: rolling-wave planning avoids over-investment in low-value work. ([Mosaic Projects](https://www.mosaicprojects.com.au/WhitePapers/WP1060_Rolling_Wave.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- AI’s economic impact:
    - Slashes cost and time of planning, analysis, documentation, experimentation.
    - Moves us from “we can’t afford to re-plan often” → “we can’t afford *not* to re-plan often.”
    - Enables your 80/20 cognitive reallocation: AI does the first 60–95%, humans spend their scarce cognition on the final 10–20% (edge cases, risk, nuance, integration).

**Visuals:**

- Simple chart: **Cost of Delay** curve vs. AI-accelerated lead time (showing reduced area under the curve).
- Table: “Old economics vs AI-accelerated economics” – rows like *Requirements, Design, Testing, Risk Analysis* showing order-of-magnitude speed-up and cognitive cost reduction.

---

## 4. AI-Accelerated Progressive Elaboration in Practice

**Purpose:** Show exactly how AI changes rolling waves and elaboration.

### 4.1 Rolling Wave vs AI-First Rolling Wave

- Old: humans gather info, write docs, run meetings → updates every few weeks/months.
- AI-First: models + context libraries generate near-term detailed plans and artefacts in hours, not weeks; plans update whenever material information changes. ([Productive](https://productive.io/blog/rolling-wave-planning/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 4.2 Context Libraries as the Engine → he Cognitive Operating System of 2026

- Define context libraries (domain rules, patterns, decisions, UX patterns, integration contracts, known failure modes).
- They are the “shared brain” feeding AI so outputs are bank-specific, not generic.
- Rally / similar tools give status and flow metrics; context libraries give semantics and domain intelligence. ([project-management.com](https://project-management.com/rally-software/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- 

### **Context Libraries: The New Engine of Flow**

### *Your signature idea — central to the model.*

- Libraries of decisions, patterns, rules, components, exceptions
- Domain intelligence encoded into reusable structures
- Powers design, product, engineering, BA, testing
- Cuts onboarding time by 90%
- Reduces cognitive load
- Turns siloed expertise → shared intelligence
- Architects → build systems, not pages
- A common truth: **great teams don’t write documents — they build libraries.**

**Visual:** Context library architecture model + input → output flow.

### 4.3 The 80/20 Cognitive Reallocation

- Enhancements: AI can generate 85–95% of docs, designs, tests, code skeletons.
- Greenfield: AI provides 40–70% scaffolding; humans resolve architecture, risk, integration.
- Humans now spend time where Flow theory says value and risk concentrate: variability, edge cases, system interactions.

### 4.4 **Talent Density > Talent Mass in the AI Era**

A small squad of high-calibre, mission-aligned individuals — each equipped with AI leverage — will outperform a much larger team where excellence is diluted and context is scattered.

Why?

Because **focused talent compounds**.

Diluted talent collides, stalls, and creates friction.

High-talent teams create a multiplier effect:

- they raise the bar for each other
- they move faster with shared context
- they align naturally without bureaucracy
- they generate clarity, not noise

**Visuals:**

- “Old wave vs new wave” side-by-side: timeline showing a chunky, slow elaboration loop vs a tight, AI-assisted, frequent loop.
- Diagram of a **Decision Packet** – a card showing Problem, Context, Economics, Options, Next Batch.

## 5. The AI-First Flow Operating Model (2026)

**Purpose:** Paint the target system you want the bank to move toward.

### 5.1 Flow-Centric Value Streams

- Work organised around domains/value streams, not projects.
- Clear entry/exit criteria for work in each stream, explicit WIP limits. ([Swarmia](https://www.swarmia.com/blog/flow-software-development/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 5.2 AI-Infused Rolling Waves

- Quarterly horizons for direction; monthly rolling waves for scope; weekly/daily waves for execution – all AI-supported.
- Rally (or equivalent) as flow telemetry + AI as planning/analysis engine. ([Medium](https://medium.com/%40nabtechblog/shifting-to-progressive-elaboration-and-choosing-rally-ea31b1904405?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 5.3 Decision OS (Decision Operating System)

- Shared principles, metrics, and thresholds for decisions: cost of delay, risk bands, service levels. ([Andrew Doran](https://andrewdoran.uk/readmill/resources/reading_the-principles-of-product-development-flow-second-generation-lean-product-development.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- AI co-pilots embedded into the decision flow for POs, designers, engineers, testers.

### 5.4 Flow Metrics and Health

- Move from “project % complete” to flow metrics: cycle time, flow efficiency, WIP, queue lengths, escaped defects. ([Swarmia](https://www.swarmia.com/blog/flow-software-development/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Visuals:**

- “Operating model canvas” style diagram: layers for **Strategy → Value Streams → Squads → AI & Tools → Metrics**.
- A small dashboard mock-up showing flow metrics and AI-suggested interventions.

## 7. Blueprint: Implementing AI-First Flow at NAB (0–360 Days)

**Purpose:** This is your “how we actually move the needle” section.

### **What NAB Looks Like in Mid-2026**

### *The future state vision.*

- near-zero cognitive waste
- 3–5× faster delivery
- stronger client outcomes
- design that solves, not decorates
- product teams that orchestrates, not coordinates
- engineers building, not documenting
- testers preventing failure, not chasing bugs
- BA/process/change teams as **intelligence engines**
- flow as the cultural norm
- AI as the invisible nervous system powering the enterprise

### 7.1 First 90 Days – Foundations

- Stand up context library v1 for a flagship domain.
- Equip a small, high-talent squad with Cursor & AI workflows.
- Define initial flow metrics, cost-of-delay framing, WIP policies.
- Pilot AI-assisted rolling-wave cadences in one or two squads.

### 7.2 90–180 Days – Scale Across the Domain

- Expand context libraries; onboard more roles (design, BA, QA) into AI-assisted elaboration.
- Integrate Rally/enterprise tooling for visibility and flow metrics. ([Medium](https://medium.com/%40nabtechblog/shifting-to-progressive-elaboration-and-choosing-rally-ea31b1904405?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Introduce Decision OS patterns for prioritisation and risk.

### 7.3 180–360 Days – Institutionalise Across the Bank

- Extend the model to adjacent domains/value streams.
- Codify AI-First Flow as the “standard way of working” in internal playbooks.
- Build training & communities of practice around Flow + Progressive Elaboration + AI.

**Visuals:**

- Roadmap timeline with three bands (Foundations / Scale / Institutionalise).
- Under each band, small icons for “People, Process, Tech, Metrics”.

## 8. Governance, Risk, and Control in an AI-First Flow World

**Purpose:** Pre-empt the “but what about risk and control?” objections.

**Content:**

- How Rally-like tools already support transparency and governance for agile at scale. ([project-management.com](https://project-management.com/rally-software/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- How AI use is governed: model risk, bias considerations, approvals for auto-generated artefacts.
- How progressive elaboration with explicit economics *reduces* risk of big-bang failures vs static plans. ([nTask](https://www.ntaskmanager.com/blog/progressive-elaboration-in-project-management/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Visuals:**

- Simple risk framework diagram: concentric circles for **Data, AI, Flow, Outcomes** with control points marked.
- RACI-style mini chart showing who owns what in the new model.

## 10. Closing: From Firefighting to Flow

**Purpose:** Land the emotional & strategic message.

- Re-state the core thesis:
    - Flow gives us the principles.
    - Progressive elaboration/rolling wave gives us the cadence.
    - AI provides the engine.
- Reaffirm your 80/20 cognitive shift as the human heart of this transformation.
- End with a short, concrete call to action: 1–2 domains, 3–6 months, clear success measures.

**Visual:**

- Final “flywheel” diagram: **AI-Accelerated Flow** → **Faster Learning** → **Better Decisions** → **Higher Value** → back to **AI-Accelerated Flow**.

If you like this structure, next we can:

- Turn Sections 0–3 into *finished Bain-style prose* first (so you’ve got a killer front half for execs),
- Or design the key diagrams so you can brief a designer to build them exactly.

Tell me which chunk you want to turn into “real pages” first, and we’ll start writing it out.
